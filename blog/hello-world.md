I am starting a blog (actually, an entire website with blogging feature).

This also serve as a testing document for this blog

## Who am I?

My name is Vinh.  
On the outside world, you may know me as a final year student majoring in Software Engineering. Over here on the internet however, you may know me as a weird person who play Minecraft a lot.

## Why am I starting a blog?

There're many reasons.

1. To save time in the future  

There're various times that I had to talk about something I've discussed in the past. While I do enjoy helping people in topics I know, spending half an hour explaining something over and over, finding material relate to the subject isn't that much enjoyable.

With this, I can link them to subjects that I've written in the past (which will include links, images and perhaps some diagrams that will be much much more detailed than via Discord messages).

2. Establish credibility about different subjects

3. I just like it

## About this blog

Obviously this will be the melting pot of my interest on various subjects. I am also not graduated yet so don't expect quality ever come out of this place.

Even with that, I still hope readers like you can find something interesting in here. Thank you in advance.
